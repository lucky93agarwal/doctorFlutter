# doctorFlutter
Hi all! Please check the app interface that can help doctors streamline their workflow. With the help of such an app, doctors can check their appointment schedules and information about their patients.

The home screen displays the doctorâ€™s schedule with key information about an appointment. The second screen displays detailed information about the patient: their name, age, and a list of diagnoses.

When creating this concept, our designers mainly used dark grey shades and accented the main UI elements with lavender colors.

This is a dark theme of the interface that can be used at any time of night and day. Thought-out navigation and clean UI will make the in-app user experience more engaging.
